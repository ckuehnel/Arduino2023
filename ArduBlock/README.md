ArduBlock
=========
ArduBlock is a programming environment designed to make physical computing with Arduino easier for beginners. Instead of writing code, worrying about syntax, and (mis)placing semicolons, ArduBlock allows you to visually program with a snapped-together list of code blocks.

The ArduBlock example here is built using [ArduBlock 2 letsgoING](https://github.com/letsgoING/ArduBlock2).
